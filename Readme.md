## Roadmap in plan


### Roadmap for Contracts

1. Create single Contract Index funds first.

    * While creating index fund take the evm addresses in constructor which will be used for indexing.
    * Write a script to determine the various chain address of the contract itself, and fund the addresses with testnet tokens for testing.
    * Write a script for automatic funding to save time.
    * Implement the easy method of investing first - user puts in Stable coin, and gets back increased or decreased stable coin - depending on how the assets did.
    * Make sure the price feed oracle is working as expected.
